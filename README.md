# InfixConverter.h contains the function declarations for the InfixConverter.cpp file. The InfixCoverter files contains code that takes an infix expression in as a string and converts it to a postfix expression primarily using stack containers to do so. Similarly, Queue.h contains the function declarations for the Queue.cpp file. These files contain code that replicates the standard queue container, offering the ability to push an element to the front of the queue, pop an element from the front of the queue, display the first element of the queue, display whether the queue is empty or not, and display the size of the queue. The main.cpp file contains code that displays the functionality of each of the functions in these files. Running main.cpp in the same file as InfixConveter.cpp, Queue.cpp, and their respective header files will allow this code to run correctly.
